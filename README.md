Vortex is a sleek, dark-themed GUI application that bypasses YouTube's resolution limits. Unlike standard downloaders, Vortex uses **FFmpeg** to merge separate video and audio streams, allowing you to download **1080p, 1440p, and 4K** videos with full audio.

## 🚀 Features
- **High Resolution Support:** Downloads true 1080p and 4K video (bypassing the 720p limit).
- **Smart Merging:** Automatically detects if a merge is needed and uses FFmpeg to combine audio/video.
- **Modern UI:** Built with `CustomTkinter` for a clean "Cyberpunk" aesthetic.
- **Format Options:** Choose between MP4 Video or extract MP3 Audio.
